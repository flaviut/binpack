# Binpack

A couple short programs to pack objects of varying lengths most efficently into
bins. The python program was reimplemented in Nim when I decided that I wanted
an excessive number of tries and realized python was way too slow.

Bins and objects are hard coded in the program, you'll have to edit the source
code to edit them.

Randomlly generates combinations of objects in bins and keeps track of the most
efficent packing so far. Probably buggy, but it works for what I wanted.

Origially used to figure out the most efficent way to cut a bunch of sticks.
